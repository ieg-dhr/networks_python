##          Network Analysis with Python for Beginners


On 24/25.02.2021, the Leibniz Institute of European History hosts a DARIAH-DE workshop on network analysis using the Python programming language. The workshop is organised by Dr. Demival Vasques, a member of the DH Lab and specialist in network science. 

On the first day, the workshop will introduce the quantitative foundations of network analysis and specific Python libraries. On the second day, the participants will create and analyse a network using the provided data. 

The workshop is suited for beginners in both network analysis and Python. However, participants should acquaint themselves with Python's syntax in advance. We will provide the links to the learning materials by the beginning of February.

The workshop is designed as a **hands-on session with tutoring**, therefore we can only admit 15 participants. The admission is on the first-come-first-served basis and is open until **10.02.2021**. The working language is English. If you want to take part, please send a short email to **digital@ieg-mainz.de** with the subject “Networks with Python”, explaining your background and reasons for participation. The workshop is free of charge.
 

**Date: 24.+ 25.02.21 <br/>
Where: virtual (via Zoom)**

   **Programm:**

- 1-2 weeks before the workshop: 
acquire necessary knowledge on Python's syntax (links to materials will be provided)

- Day 1:
10 - 12 am: introduction and demonstartion (synchronous learning) <br/>
13 - 16:30 pm: preparing own projects (asynchronous learning) <br/>
14:00-14:30, 16:00-16:30: Virtual office hours 

- Day 2:
10 -12 am: presentation of the results 

**Preparation:**
- Important: install and get comfartable with Anaconda3. It contains all packages we will need (Jupyter notebooks included)
- On our GitHub - https://github.com/ieg-dhr/ieg_workshops/tree/master/2021_02_networks_python - there are 2 Jupyter Notebooks: 
**Introduction_Jupyter_Python.ipynb** and **Intro_Data_Analysis_with_Python.ipynb** 
You'll need to go through these 2 in order to be prepared. There is also a Jupyter Notebook **assignment.ipynb** if you want to check your understanding (the document is not long, you may need < 1h)
